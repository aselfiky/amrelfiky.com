This website is mainly created for me to learn Node.js and experiment with dynamic content, and I only get to work on this project in my free time. It is hosted on Heroku and uses HTML and CSS for the frontend. 

## Goals
* Learn Node.js/Express.js
* Host my resume
* Interactive projects page
* Use some APIs to do random cool dynamic stuff
* Maybe link MongoDB for a webapp
* Have fun and be creative in building this website
